<h3>First Movement!</h3>
<p><i>November 2018</i></p>
<p><b>Peter</b></p>
<p>This month we have made great strides of progress in our micromouse project: completing the intra-red and line following circuits on breadboard, 
testing different IR sensors, and building a prototype micromouse robot that was able to move in a straight line and detect collisions.</p>
<p>We were also given the PCB Schematic for the infra-red circuit, which I have been laying out on a PCB. To do this I have been using Proteus EDA software.</p>
<p>The website has seen great improvement over this month, with the addition of the project management section and public documents. Overall I'm very 
pleased the the progress and development that Team:India has achieved over the past few weeks</p>

<p>This Month Jacky and I got the LDR breadboard circuit working. We derived optimal resistor values to replace the potentiometer for the final circuit. 
The rest of my lab time was spent on researching and coming up with ideas for the Aesthetic Design and what the special feature of our Micromouse could be. 
Our favourite idea is to use a Boost Converter to get more energy of the battery onto the track. It still needs to be decided on whether it is possible or 
worth it to build one from scratch, or if it is cheaper and more effective to get premade components in order to get a more consistent output voltage.</p>

<p>On November the MM circuit have been built in breadboard and test it works successfully.</p>
<p>We have test the wheels and the speed of them.</p>
<p>The website is ready to be publish.</p>
<p>Our plans for next month to finish the circuit in the actual board and do the sensors for the MM.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Jacky</b></p>
<p>In the time of November, I tested the speed condition of the motor which is connected to the microcontroller. In the test, we use the HMC 8042 (Rohde&Schwarz)
 power supply as the power source of the motor. We tested the motor with the input voltage which with is lower than 4 volts.  Also, I proposed some ideas to the 
team about how the outer frame of our micromouse should be. Such as a character from the mobile game(Plants VS Zomble) and R2D2 from Star Wars.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p><i>October 2018</i></p>
<p><b>Peter</b></p>
<p>The goal of the first month of the MicroMouse project was to establish ourselves as a team, discover what 
each other's strengths and weaknesses were, and ultimately to get started with some of the first tasks we 
need to achieve to get the project on the road.</p>
<p>Our team was chosen by the Electrical and Electronic Engineering departmnet, by pairing together students 
with a variety of different skillsets, in order to create a balanced team. One of our first tasks was to use 
this information to decide which aspects of the project we'd each be best at doing, based on our skillsets.</p>

<p>We completed a skills matrix, allocating different team members to each part of the project. We were also 
tasked with setting up a Microsoft Team group, complete with a Kanban project management board, group chat 
and file collaboration. We quickly grew used to the Kanban board, using it to assign tasks that needed to be 
completed. The Kanban system allows us to move tasks between three columns. 'Deliverables, Work in Progress,
 and Done'. </p>

<p>Organization and project planning consumed most of the time of the first month. The two main topics I was 
busy with was setting up a basic Website for our team with Peter and building an LDR bread board circuit with Jacky. 
Once working and tested this circuit will be used for the line following task. To enhance the design of our 
website I started to recap on basic html and CSS programming using the Website <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>.</p>
<br>

<p>In first session for EG-252 each student has choose roles and skills to start work in micromouse.
Teams were choose randomly. In first week for micromouse project was for team bonding and decide what to do 
and the responsibilities for each member of the team. I have choose to do hardware stuff such as breadboard 
and soldering. Breadboard has been built in the laboratory. Last lab in October is the assessment week 
for project management and project skills matrix.</p>

<p><b>Jacky</b></p>
<p> At first, I had discussed with my teammates about the positions of each persons in the whole project. After allocating the duties, I am the researcher of the team. It is basically a job of finding useful information that I can enhance the quality of our product. Then,  I was busy building up the white line sensor, which is able to keep our micromouse moving along a white line, with jojo.</p>
